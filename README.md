# Mad Libs Python Project

## About the project

Mad Libs is a fun and interactive word game where users provide words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to fill in blanks in a story without knowing the full context. Once all the words are entered, the completed story is revealed, often with amusing results!
